% Arabica is a modular and user friendly framework for state-of-the-art data
% analysis. If you really must know what is stands for, think of "Adaptive
% Robust Additions to Bagging ICA". However, one could argue that the following
% summarizes the real motivation for the dark and tender roast behind the name:
%   "Coffee is commercially available as one of two varieties known as arabica
%   and robusta. Coffee beverages are made from roasted beans of arabica and
%   robusta, or blends of these two. Arabica coffees are generally considered of
%   better quality and consequently they command higher prices."
